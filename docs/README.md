## Issues

* Redo archives plugin, based on newer code from Arvados version
* Add Read More button to Blog Main Page
* Finishing replacing relative URLs where relevant
  * See [CDN - Cloudflare](#cdn---cloudflare) regarding performance
* Blog logo issue
* Homepage Logo issue?
  * Previous note: Seems to be a result of bootstrap's `margin-left: -15px; margin-right: -15px;` setting on `.row` classes
* Blog page would seriously benefit from CDN!!
* Add ARIA roles
* Figure out what `defaults` can be removed from `_config.yml`
* Double check: 
  * favicon w/ Real Favicon Generator (should be fine)
  * Contact Form
* Verify site with Webmaster Tools, prior to launch
* Flickr API for Sidebar(?) - Is this still relevant?

### Gravatars Fallback

Something like this, but in reverse/more nuanced:

```html
{% for author in site.authors %}
{% if author.image and author.image != '/assets/images/no_gravatar.png' %}
  <img src="{{ author.image }}" alt="Author thumbnail for {{ author.name }}" class="avatar avatar-48 grav-hased" height="48" width="48"></a></li>
  {% elsif author.email %}
    <script>
      document.write('<li><a id="{{ author.gravatar_name }}" href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{{ author.url }}">')
      document.write('<img src="' + get_gravatar('{{ author.email }}', 48) + '" alt="Author thumbnail for {{ author.name }}" class="avatar avatar-48 grav-hased" height="48" width="48" /></a></li>');
    </script>

  {% endif %}        
{% endfor%}

```

### Replace Captions and Shortcodes

1. Shortcodes need to be replaced with actual code wherever possible. See e.g. [here](http://localhost:4000/2012/11/27/wildlife-of-our-homes-q-a-with-rob-dunn/).
  * `[caption]` covers 21 posts. I can't say for other shortcodes without manually looking through posts.
  * `[youtube]` covers 8 posts
  * `[polldaddy]`covers 1 posts

<a id="scss-extranon-essential"></a>
### SCSS (extra/non-essential)

1. Replace all fixed line heights w/ relative numbers
    * Using a base SCSS variable wherever possible
2. Month Archives: 425px, 768px - would be nice to tweak the styles a bit, so the Archive Title doesn't split into the next line
